        involved.
        More specifically, we may need to process your data or share your personal information in the following
        situations:<br><br>
        <b>Vendors, Consultants, and Other Third-Party Service Providers.</b>  We may share your data with third-party vendors,
        service providers, contractors, or agents who perform services for us or on our behalf and require access to
        such information to do that work. Examples include payment processing, data analysis, email delivery, hosting
        services, customer service, and marketing efforts. We may allow selected third parties to use tracking
        technology on the Services, which will enable them to collect data about how you interact with the Services over
        time. This information may be used to, among other things, analyze and track data, determine the popularity of
        certain content, and better understand online activity. Unless described in this Policy, we do not share, sell,
        rent, or trade any of your information with third parties for their promotional purposes.<br><br>
       <b>Business Transfers.</b>  We may share or transfer your information in connection with, or during negotiations of, any

        you.<br><br>
       <b>Affiliates.</b>  We may share your information with our members, in which case we will require those affiliates to
        honour this privacy policy. Affiliates include our parent company and any subsidiaries, joint venture partners,
        or other companies that we control or that are under common control with us.

        information may be transferred to, stored, and processed by us in our facilities and by those third parties with
        whom we may share your personal information, in and other countries.
        If you are a resident in the European Economic Area, then these countries may not have data protection or other
        laws as comprehensive as those in your country. We will, however, take all necessary measures to protect your
        personal information following this privacy policy and applicable law.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="row">
      <h3>6. WHAT IS OUR STANCE ON THIRD-PARTY WEBSITES?</h3>
      <p>In Short: We are not responsible for the safety of any information that you share with third-party providers
        who advertise, but are not affiliated with, our websites.
        The Services may contain advertisements from third parties that are not affiliated with us and which may link to
        other websites, online services, or mobile applications. We cannot guarantee the safety and privacy of data you
        provide to any third parties. This privacy policy does not cover any data collected by third parties. We are not
        responsible for the content or privacy and security practices and policies of any third parties, including other
        websites, services, or applications that may be linked to or from the Services. You should review the policies
        of such third parties and contact them directly to respond to your questions.

        privacy policy unless a more extended retention period is required or permitted by law (such as tax, accounting,
        or other legal requirements). No purpose in this Policy will require us keeping your personal information for
        longer than one year.
        When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or
        anonymize it, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your data has been stored in backup archives),
        then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion
        is possible.
      </p>
    </div>

        minor dependent’s use of the Services. If we learn that personal information from users less than 18 years of
        age has been collected, we will deactivate the account and take reasonable measures to promptly delete such data

        Cookies and similar technologies: Most Web browsers are set to accept cookies by default. If you prefer, you can

    </div>

    <div class="row">
      <h3>10. CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES</h3>
      <p></p>Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track (“DNT”)
      feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your online browsing
      activities monitored and collected. No uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals
      has been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that
      automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted that
      we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that practise in a revised version of this privacy policy.
